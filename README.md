[![Unit Tests](https://github.com/stavares843/echo-server-test/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/stavares843/echo-server-test/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml)

This adds a server that listens for incoming requests. Whenever we send it an HTTP request, will respond by sending back everything you sent it — your request path, headers, and so forth.

The server is written in Python and listens on port 8080.

Requests:
- GET request, it echoes back the requested path and the headers.
- POST request, it echoes back any data additional to the headers.

How to use:
- clone repo
- go to repo
- go to this branch
- run `python3 echo_server.py`

Once it’s running, you can send requests to it, like typing http://localhost:8080/test in the browser or executing a curl to test it.
